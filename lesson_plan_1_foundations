# Lesson Plan 1: Data & Analytics Foundations  
## 5-Day Instruction Plan (10 Hours Total)

**Audience:** First-year college student (likely Economics major)  
**Format:** 5 days × 2 sessions/day × 1 hour/session  
**Instruction Mode:** Mixed face-to-face (F2F) and remote/asynchronous  
**Lesson Goal:** Establish strong data literacy and analytical foundations; prepare the student for future coursework involving statistics, regression, and public-domain economic data.

---

## Lesson Plan 1 Learning Objectives

By the end of Lesson Plan 1, the student should be able to:

- Understand what “data” represents in practical analytical contexts
- Identify and reason about data types, missing values, and basic data quality issues
- Work comfortably with tabular data, especially CSV files
- Understand relational data concepts (tables, primary keys, foreign keys)
- Write and interpret core SQL queries
- Reason correctly about aggregation vs disaggregation
- Use Python/pandas as a “power spreadsheet” for basic analysis
- Choose appropriate visualizations and interpret results correctly
- Understand the end-to-end analytics pipeline:  
  **raw data → structured data → query → visualization → insight**

Advanced topics (statistics, regression, ML, performance tuning, big data systems) are explicitly **out of scope** for Lesson Plan 1.

## Tooling (Lesson Plan 1)

- **Spreadsheets:** Google Sheets (preferred), Excel acceptable
- **Relational Database:** Managed PostgreSQL (e.g., Supabase, Neon)
- **Query Language:** Core SQL only  
  - SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY  
  - GROUP BY  
  - INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
- **Python:** pandas for loading, filtering, and aggregating data
- **Visualization:** One BI tool only (Tableau Public or Power BI Free)

Python is positioned as a **powerful spreadsheet**, not as software engineering.

## Day-by-Day Instruction Plan

## Day 1 — Data Fundamentals & Mental Models (F2F)

**Day Objective:** Build intuition about data before introducing tools.

### Session 1 (1 hour)
- What “data” actually is in practice
- Rows, columns, records, and fields
- Data types:
  - Numeric
  - Categorical
  - Text
- Units and scaling
- Common data quality failures

### Session 2 (1 hour)
- Missing values:
  - NULL vs empty vs zero
- Cardinality:
  - Low vs high
  - Why it matters for analysis and visualization
- CSV as the canonical data mental model
- Inspecting real CSV files in a spreadsheet
- Preview of the full analytics pipeline

**Remote / Homework**
- Inspect multiple CSV files
- Identify:
  - Data types
  - Missing values
  - Cardinality issues
- Short written reflections on observed data quality problems

---

## Day 2 — Relational Data & SQL Fundamentals (F2F)

**Day Objective:** Develop relational thinking and introduce SQL as a query language.

### Session 1 (1 hour)
- Tables as structured representations of entities
- Primary keys and foreign keys
- One-to-many relationships
- Why normalization exists (conceptual motivation only)

**Optional (Conceptual Exposure): Fact Tables vs Dimension Tables**
- Fact tables represent measurable events or observations (“what happened”)
- Dimension tables provide descriptive context (“who, what, where, when”)
- Introduced for intuition only; no formal schema design required
- This topic may be revisited and expanded in **Lesson Plan 2**

### Session 2 (1 hour)
- Core SQL concepts:
  - SELECT
  - WHERE
  - ORDER BY
  - LIMIT
- Querying a shared PostgreSQL dataset
- Reading queries top-to-bottom
- Interpreting result sets

**Remote / Homework**
- Write basic SELECT queries
- Apply filters and sorting
- Answer simple analytical questions using SQL

---

## Day 3 — Joins, Aggregation, and Analytical Reasoning (F2F)

**Day Objective:** Build correct analytical reasoning and avoid common mistakes.

### Session 1 (1 hour)
- INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN
- Join logic and row multiplication
- Join cardinality and duplication errors
- Visual explanation of joins
- Optional reference to fact/dimension roles when reasoning about joins (expanded in Lesson Plan 2)

### Session 2 (1 hour)
- GROUP BY
- Aggregation functions:
  - COUNT
  - SUM
  - AVG
- Aggregation vs disaggregation
- Common analytical mistakes
- Interpreting grouped results correctly

**Remote / Homework**
- Join fact and dimension-style tables
- Produce grouped summaries
- Explain results in plain English (no SQL)

---

## Day 4 — Python as a Power Spreadsheet (Hybrid)

**Day Objective:** Build confidence using Python/pandas for basic analysis.

### Session 1 (1 hour, F2F)
- Why Python exists in analytics workflows
- pandas mental model vs spreadsheets vs SQL
- Loading CSV data
- Inspecting dataframes
- Filtering rows
- Grouping and aggregation

### Session 2 (1 hour, Remote / Guided)
- Guided notebook exercises:
  - Load dataset
  - Clean and filter data
  - Aggregate results
  - Export outputs
- Instructor review (async or live-remote)

---

## Day 5 — Visualization, Interpretation & Synthesis (F2F)

**Day Objective:** Turn mechanics into insight and reinforce end-to-end thinking.

### Session 1 (1 hour)
- Choosing appropriate chart types
- Aggregated vs raw visualizations
- Avoiding misleading visuals
- What *not* to chart
- Reading charts critically

### Session 2 (1 hour)
- BI tool exposure (Tableau Public or Power BI Free)
- Connect to shared PostgreSQL dataset
- Build 1–2 simple visuals
- End-to-end walkthrough:
